## The mobject-datatypes Library

This is one of the many libraries of [mobject](http://mobject.org). This library focuses on representing data types as objects.

## What is mobject?

Pronounced mob-ject.

A sprinkling of OOP is usually enough to simplify and unclutter procedural code. However, the more you apply OOP, the more you find the need to expand it's scope to accommodate functionality which is missing from the language. Hence, mobject was conceived. It's a framework, library and mindset of how problems such as this can be resolved using both pre-written code and examples.

mobject's goal is to be a lightweight solution to typical oop problems.

## Why use mobject-types?

The mobject-datatypes library provides a consistent way to handle data types as objects. Focus is with the serialization and deserialization of primitives. This library can be used as a base for custom data types as objects.
